            <h2>Inventer of JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Brendan Eich ( born July 4, 1961) is an American computer programmer and technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he was appointed chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his appointment due to pressure over his firm opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software. JavaScript quickly became one of the essential scripting languages for web development, enabling dynamic and interactive content on websites. After Netscape, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project in 1998, aiming to develop an open-source web browser. This project eventually led to the creation of Mozilla Firefox.
